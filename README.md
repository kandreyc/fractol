## Subject
**Mandatory part** - to create a small fractal exploration program. Here is a list of requirements:  
* Software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals, from which at least the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set (a third fractal is my choice).  
  
* It must be possible to vary the mouse (without clicking) the parameter of the Julia
set. The other types of fractal, it is left to your option.  
  
* The mouse wheel zooms in and out on the current mouse position, and this in a quasi infinite way (modulo the limits of the machine). This is the same principle of fractals.  
  
* There must be a minimum play of color to feel the depth of each fractal.  
  
* A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal is to
view. If there is no parameter provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program
displays a list of available parameters and exits.  
  
**Bonus part** - my imagination. Here is a list of bonuses, that I added to my project:  
* Multithreaded calculating/recalculating scene.
* Multiple Scenes in multiple windows, implemented through fork (an operation whereby a process creates a copy of itself).
* Real time fractal recalculating/redrawing with visual changing, depending on the position of the mouse,
* 3 additional fractals:
  * Sunflower
  * Recursive tree
  * Mandelbrot in cube
* 5 different color schemes.
